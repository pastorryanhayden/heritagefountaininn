Pastor Nate Beam accepted Christ as Savior as a young boy. He grew up in Connecticut, and took advantage of many opportunities to preach and teach Godâ€™s Word throughout his junior high and high school years. Sensing a call to preach, he attended a small Bible college in North Carolina, and he graduated with a degree in Biblical Studies. Before coming to Heritage, he travelled as an evangelist, holding meetings in many states and several foreign countries. 

Pastor Nate is married to Jessica and has 1 son, Elisha.
